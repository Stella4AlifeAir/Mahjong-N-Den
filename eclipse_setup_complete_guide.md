‚úÖ **Eclipse is ready!**

---

## üìã PART 3: INSTALL J2ME (MOBILE EMULATOR)

### Step 8: Install EclipseME Plugin

**The Challenge**: EclipseME is an old plugin (2005) and may not be available in modern Eclipse.

**Option A: Try Eclipse Marketplace** (might work)

1. In Eclipse, go to: **Help** ‚Üí **Eclipse Marketplace...**
2. Search for: **"J2ME"** or **"EclipseME"**
3. If you find it, click **Install**
4. If NOT found, proceed to Option B

---

**Option B: Manual Installation** (Recommended)

Since EclipseME is discontinued, we'll use an alternative approach:

1. **Download Java ME SDK** (Oracle)
   - Go to: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javame-sdk-downloads.html
   - Download **Java ME SDK 8.3**
   - Install it (default location is fine)

2. **OR use Microemulator** (Simpler alternative)
   - We'll set this up in the next section

---

### Step 9: Download Microemulator (Simple Alternative)

**Microemulator** = Standalone J2ME emulator (easier than EclipseME)

1. Go to: https://github.com/barteo/microemulator/releases
2. Download: **microemulator-2.0.4.zip**
3. **Extract the ZIP** to a folder:
   ```
   C:\microemulator\
   ```
4. You should have:
   ```
   C:\microemulator\microemulator.jar
   C:\microemulator\lib\
   ```

‚úÖ **Emulator downloaded!**

---

## üìã PART 4: IMPORT THE MAHJONG PROJECT

### Step 10: Prepare the Project Folder

1. Navigate to your downloaded repository:
   ```
   D:\Project\Mahjong Den Development\New Mahjong Den\Mahjong Den ver 001\_backup_mahjongbt\mjbt\
   ```

2. **Copy the entire `mjbt` folder** to a simpler location:
   ```
   C:\MahjongProject\
   ```

   So you have:
   ```
   C:\MahjongProject\mjbt\
   ```

---

### Step 11: Import Project to Eclipse

**In Eclipse**:

1. **File** ‚Üí **Import...**

2. Expand **General**

3. Select **"Existing Projects into Workspace"**

4. Click **Next**

5. **Select root directory**: Click **Browse...**
   - Navigate to: `C:\MahjongProject\mjbt`
   - Click **Select Folder**

6. The project should appear in the list with a checkbox ‚úì

7. ‚úÖ **Check**: "Copy projects into workspace"

8. Click **Finish**

---

### Step 12: Wait for Eclipse to Build

Eclipse will automatically start building the project.

**Look at the bottom-right corner** of Eclipse:
- You'll see: "Building workspace..." with a progress bar

**This may take 1-5 minutes.**

When done, you'll see the project in **Package Explorer** on the left:
```
mjbt
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ com.pheephoo.mjgame
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ com.pheephoo.utilx
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ res
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ JRE System Library
```

---

### Step 13: Check for Errors

**Look at Package Explorer**:
- ‚ùå **Red X icons** = Errors (need to fix)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Yellow ! icons** = Warnings (can ignore)

**Common errors**:
1. **"javax.microedition cannot be resolved"** - Missing J2ME libraries
2. **"JRE System Library unbound"** - Wrong Java version

---

### Step 14: Add J2ME Libraries (If Errors)

**If you see import errors**:

1. **Right-click** on the project `mjbt`
2. **Properties** ‚Üí **Java Build Path**
3. Click **Libraries** tab
4. Click **Add External JARs...**
5. Navigate to:
   ```
   C:\microemulator\lib\
   ```
6. Select **ALL .jar files**
7. Click **Open**
8. Click **Apply and Close**

The project should rebuild automatically.

---

## üìã PART 5: CONFIGURE AND RUN

### Step 15: Find the Main Class

**In Package Explorer**, expand:
```
mjbt ‚Üí com.pheephoo.mjgame ‚Üí MJGame.java
```

**Double-click** `MJGame.java` to open it.

You should see the source code in the editor.

---

### Step 16: Create Run Configuration

**Method A: Simple Run** (Try this first)

1. **Right-click** on `MJGame.java` in Package Explorer
2. **Run As** ‚Üí **Java Application**

**If you see an error** about "Selection does not contain a main type", proceed to Method B.

---

**Method B: Manual Configuration**

1. **Run** ‚Üí **Run Configurations...**

2. **Double-click** "Java Application" in the left list
   - This creates a new configuration

3. **Name**: Type `Mahjong Game`

4. **Project**: Click **Browse...** ‚Üí Select `mjbt`

5. **Main class**: Click **Search...** ‚Üí Select `MJGame`

6. **Arguments** tab:
   - VM arguments: (leave empty for now)

7. **Classpath** tab:
   - Make sure `mjbt` project is listed
   - Make sure J2ME libraries are listed

8. Click **Apply**

9. Click **Run**

---

### Step 17: First Run - Expect Errors!

**You'll likely see errors because**:
- J2ME MIDlet needs special runtime
- Database connection needs setup
- Network server is offline

**Common errors you'll see**:
```
javax.microedition.midlet.MIDletStateChangeException
```
OR
```
ClassNotFoundException: javax.microedition.lcdui.Display
```

This is **NORMAL**! We need the emulator.

---

## üìã PART 6: RUN WITH MICROEMULATOR

### Step 18: Run Using Microemulator

**Open Command Prompt**:

```cmd
cd C:\microemulator
java -jar microemulator.jar
```

**Microemulator window opens** (looks like a phone screen!)

---

### Step 19: Load the Game

**In Microemulator window**:

1. **File** ‚Üí **Open MIDlet File...**

2. Navigate to:
   ```
   C:\MahjongProject\mjbt\deployed\mjbt.jar
   ```

3. Click **Open**

4. **Select**: `BT Demo` (the MIDlet)

5. Click **Start**

---

### Step 20: Play the Game!

**If successful, you should see**:
1. **Splash screen** (Mahjong logo)
2. **Main menu** with options:
   - Play
   - Private Network
   - Public Network
   - Settings
   - About
   - Exit

3. **Click "Play"** ‚Üí Game starts with 3 AI opponents!

üéâ **YOU'RE PLAYING THE ORIGINAL 2005 GAME!**

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue 1: "Cannot find mjbt.jar"

**Solution**: Build the JAR file

1. In Eclipse, right-click project
2. **Export** ‚Üí **JAR file**
3. Select `mjbt` project
4. Export destination: `C:\MahjongProject\mjbt\deployed\mjbt.jar`
5. Click **Finish**
6. Try loading in Microemulator again

---

### Issue 2: "Error loading MIDlet"

**Solution**: Check the JAD file

1. Open `mjbt.jad` in Notepad
2. Make sure this line points to the correct JAR:
   ```
   MIDlet-Jar-URL: mjbt.jar
   ```
3. Make sure JAR and JAD are in same folder

---

### Issue 3: Game tries to connect to network and fails

**Solution**: Play offline mode

1. In main menu, click **"Play"** (not "Private Network" or "Public Network")
2. This starts offline mode with AI opponents
3. No network needed!

---

### Issue 4: Black screen or crash

**Possible causes**:
- Missing resources (images/sounds)
- Wrong Java version
- Corrupted JAR file

**Solutions**:
1. Re-extract the ZIP from GitHub
2. Make sure `res` folder is included in JAR
3. Try rebuilding the project

---

### Issue 5: Can't see tiles/images

**Solution**: Make sure resources are in JAR

**Check JAR contents**:
1. Copy `mjbt.jar` to Desktop
2. Rename to `mjbt.zip`
3. Extract it
4. Look for `res` folder with PNG files
5. If missing, need to rebuild with resources

---

## üéØ ALTERNATIVE: USE ECLIPSE DEBUGGING

### Method: Run as Console Application (No Graphics)

If emulator doesn't work, you can still test the game logic:

**Create a test class**:

```java
public class TestMahjong {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Test tile creation
        Tile tile = new Tile(Tile.CHARACTER, 5);
        System.out.println("Created tile: " + tile);
        
        // Test deck shuffling
        MahjongDeck deck = new MahjongDeck();
        deck.shuffle();
        System.out.println("Deck shuffled with " + deck.size() + " tiles");
        
        // Test scoring
        WinEngine winEngine = new WinEngine();
        // ... add test code
    }
}
```

**Run this** to test core game logic without UI.
